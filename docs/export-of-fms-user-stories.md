Please select another seat.”<br><br>Step 3: Review Seat Pricing and Preferences (Seat Pricing & Confirmation Review)<br>Goal: The system presents pricing details (if applicable) and summary for the selected seats before final confirmation.<br>Display Rules:<br>- Show seat fee (if seat selection incurs an additional charge).<br>- Total amount updates dynamically when the user changes seat selections.Offer filters or highlights for seat preferences: “Show only window seats”, “Show seats near front”, “Hide occupied seats”<br>Validation & Error Handling:<br>- If payment integration is required for premium seats:<br>- The system checks payment eligibility before proceeding.<br>- If payment fails, selected premium seats revert to unselected state with an alert message.<br><br>Step 4: Confirm and Save Seat Selection (Seat Assignment Confirmation)<br>Goal: The customer confirms their final seat choices, and the system assigns seats to passengers in the booking.<br>Data Constraints & Validation Rules:<br>- System re-validates seat availability before final confirmation.<br>- Seat assignments are saved and linked to the customer’s PNR (Passenger Name Record).<br>- If session expires before confirmation → selected seats are released automatically.<br>System Behavior:<br>- On successful seat assignment:<br>+ Display confirmation message: “Seats successfully assigned to your booking.”<br>+ Update booking record with seat numbers (e.g., “Passenger 1 – 12A”).<br>- On failure (e.g., API or DB error): Show error: “Seat assignment failed. Please try again or contact support.” |
| 7 | As a Customer, I want to make secure payments through integrated payment gateways such that I can complete my bookings with confidence in transaction security. | Customers need the ability to view seating layouts and pick seats that match their preferences, such as window, aisle, or extra-legroom options. This enhances comfort and improves satisfaction with the booking experience. | Step 1: Payment Interface Access<br>- Customer proceeds to checkout showing total fare, taxes, and selected services.<br>- Supported methods: credit/debit cards, e-wallets, bank transfer, or online payment providers.<br><br>Step 2: Enter and Validate Payment Details<br>- User enters payment info (card number, expiry, CVV, name).<br>- System validates format and checks transaction limits.<br>- Sensitive data encrypted (PCI DSS compliance).<br><br>Step 3: Process Transaction<br>- Payment sent to gateway via secure API.<br>- Gateway responds with success, failure, or pending status.<br>- If timeout → show “Payment temporarily unavailable, please retry.”<br><br>Step 4: Confirm and Generate Receipt<br>- On success:<br>+ Booking marked as Paid/Confirmed.<br>+ E-ticket and receipt generated and emailed automatically.<br>- On failure: display reason and allow retry or alternate payment method. |
| 8 | As a Flight Scheduling Employee, I want to create flight schedules such that I can ensure proper route planning and operational efficiency. | Flight scheduling employees need tools to create flight schedules. This ensures that routes are properly planned, flights are efficiently allocated, and operations run smoothly. | Step 1: Access and Initiate Flight Creation<br>Goal: The Flight Scheduling Employee navigates to the flight management interface and opens the form to create a new flight schedule.<br>System Behavior:<br>- The employee logs in with their designated scheduling credentials.<br>- From the main dashboard, they access the "Flight Management" section.<br>- The employee clicks an "Add Flight" button, which opens a form to enter the details for a new flight.<br><br>Step 2: Enter Flight Details (Form Input)<br>Goal: The employee fills in all required information for the new flight, including route, timing, aircraft, and any intermediate stops.<br>System Behavior: The employee uses the new flight form to input the following details:<br>- Flight Code: A unique identifier for the flight.<br>- Departure/Arrival Airports: Selected from a searchable list of available airports.<br>- Departure/Arrival Times: Chosen using a date-time picker.<br>- Aircraft: An available aircraft is selected from a searchable list.<br>- Intermediate Stops (Layovers):<br>+ The employee can add one or more layovers.<br>+ For each layover, they select an airport and specify the arrival time and the duration of the stop.<br>Data Constraints & Validation Rules:<br>- Departure and arrival airports must be different.<br>- The flight's arrival time must be later than its departure time.<br>- The total flight duration must meet a configured minimum time.<br>- The number of layovers cannot exceed a predefined system limit.<br>- Layover durations must fall within a configured minimum and maximum time range.<br>- All layover times must be chronologically ordered between the flight's main departure and final arrival.<br><br>Step 3: Submit Flight Creation Request<br>Goal: The system receives the new flight data, validates it, and prepares it for creation.<br>Execution Method:<br>- The employee clicks the "Save Flight" button to submit the form.<br>- The user interface packages the form data and sends a request to the backend system to create the new flight schedule.<br><br>Step 4: Process and Save Flight Schedule<br>Goal: The backend processes the request, performs final validation, and persists the new flight schedule in the database.<br>System Behavior:<br>- The backend system receives the request to create a new flight.<br>- It performs a final, comprehensive validation of all submitted data against the system's business rules and operational constraints.<br>- If all data is valid, the new flight and its associated layover details are saved to the database.<br><br>Step 5: Display Confirmation and Update List<br>Goal: The system confirms the successful creation of the flight and updates the flight list to include the new schedule.<br>System Behavior:<br>- Upon successful creation, the flight entry form closes.<br>- A success notification ("Flight created successfully") is displayed to the employee.<br>- The main list of flights on the screen automatically refreshes to include the newly added flight, providing immediate confirmation that the operation was completed.<br>- If an error occurs, a descriptive message is shown, allowing the employee to correct the information and try again. |
| 9 | As a Flight Scheduling Employee, I want to monitor Flight Operating and make real-time adjustments such that I can respond to operational changes and maintain schedule integrity. | Flight scheduling employees need visibility into ongoing Flight Operating and the ability to respond quickly to unexpected events such as delays, cancellations, or weather disruptions. This ensures the overall schedule remains reliable and consistent. | Step 1: Access Real-Time Operations Dashboard<br>- Flight Scheduling Employees open a live dashboard showing all active and upcoming flights.<br>- Key data displayed: flight number, route, aircraft, crew, gate, and current status (On-Time, Delayed, Cancelled, Diverted).<br>- Dashboard updates continuously from operational and ATC data sources.<br><br>Step 2: Receive Operational Alerts and Updates<br>- System automatically notifies staff of disruptions like weather delays, maintenance issues, or crew shortages.<br>- Alerts categorized by priority (Critical, Moderate, Informational) for quick response.<br>- Employees can filter or acknowledge alerts to track ongoing issues.<br><br>Step 3: Perform Real-Time Adjustments<br>- Employees can adjust schedules directly from the dashboard — change departure times, swap aircraft, or reassign crew.<br>- System validates changes against crew duty limits, maintenance status, and airport slot availability.<br>- Warnings appear if adjustments violate operational or safety constraints.<br><br>Step 4: Coordinate and Communicate Updates<br>- Once changes are confirmed, automatic notifications are sent to passengers, crew, and ground teams.<br>- Flight information displays and connected systems (ticketing, gate assignment, baggage) update in real time.<br>- Internal chat or message logs allow coordination among departments.<br><br>Step 5: Record Adjustments and Generate Reports<br>- Every operational change logged with timestamp, staff ID, and reason (e.g., weather delay, technical fault).<br>- System generates post-operation reports on delay duration, causes, and actions taken.<br>- Data contributes to performance metrics and regulatory compliance records. |
| 10 | As a Flight Scheduling Employee, I want to manage flight information and schedules such that I can maintain accurate and current flight data. | Flight scheduling employees require the ability to manage flight details such as timings, routes, and operational notes. Keeping flight information up to date ensures accuracy across booking, ticketing, and operations systems. | Step 1: Access Flight Management Module (Flight Information Interface)<br>Goal: Allow the flight scheduling employee to access and manage all flight-related data from a centralized interface.<br>System Behavior & Data Handling Rules:<br>- The employee opens the Flight Management Dashboard, which lists all existing flights with key information: Flight Number, Route (Departure → Arrival), Departure/Arrival Times, Aircraft, Status.<br>- Search & Filter Capabilities:<br>+ Filter by flight number, date, route, or status (Active, Scheduled, Cancelled).<br>+ Search using partial or full flight identifiers.<br>System Behavior:<br>- Display a paginated list of flights sorted by date (upcoming flights shown first).<br>- Provide buttons for actions: Add New Flight, Edit, Delete, View Details.<br>- If no flights match filters → show message: “No flights found for the selected criteria.”<br><br>Step 2: Add New Flight Information (Flight Creation Form)<br>Goal: Enable employees to create new flight entries with essential operational and scheduling details.<br>Data Constraints & Validation Rules:<br>- Required Fields:<br>+ Flight Number: Must be unique and follow airline format (e.g., VN123).<br>+ Departure Airport & Arrival Airport: Required, cannot be identical.<br>+ Departure Date & Time: Must be later than the current time.<br>+ Arrival Date & Time: Must be later than departure.<br>+ Aircraft ID: Must correspond to a valid, active aircraft.<br>+ Optional Fields: Operational Notes, Route Code, Estimated Duration, Crew Assignment.<br>System Behavior:<br>- Auto-calculates estimated flight duration based on route distance.<br>- Validates aircraft and crew availability (no overlapping schedules).<br>- Displays confirmation summary before saving.<br>Error Handling:<br>- If duplicate flight number detected → show: “Flight number already exists.”<br>- If required field missing → highlight and prompt correction.<br><br>Step 3: Edit Existing Flight Details (Update Flight Information)<br>Goal: Allow employees to modify existing flight data while preserving consistency and operational integrity.<br>Execution Method:<br>- Select a flight → click Edit → open editable form with current details pre-filled.<br>- Editable Fields: Departure/Arrival times, Airports, Aircraft, Crew, and Operational Notes.<br>Validation & Data Constraints:<br>- Cannot modify flight already marked as “Departed” or “Cancelled.”<br>- Adjustments to time must not cause overlap with other scheduled flights for the same aircraft or crew.<br>- Changes to route automatically update flight duration and estimated fuel requirements.<br>System Behavior:<br>- Shows before/after comparison summary before saving.<br>- Upon saving, updates propagate to linked systems (Booking, Operations).<br>- All changes logged with timestamp and user ID for audit tracking.<br><br>Step 4: Manage Flight Routes and Operational Notes (Route & Notes Management)<br>Goal: Maintain accurate routing and operational information for each flight to support ground and air operations.<br>System Behavior & Rules:<br>Each flight record may include:<br>- Route Code or Waypoints: Defines standard flight path.<br>- Alternate Airports: Listed for emergency or diversion planning.<br>- Operational Notes: Free-text field for scheduling staff to add remarks (e.g., “Aircraft swap planned due to maintenance”).<br>Data Constraints & Validation:<br>- Route codes must match existing predefined routes in the system.<br>- Notes limited to 500 characters.<br>System Behavior:<br>- Updates to routes trigger recalculation of duration and fuel estimates.<br>- Operational notes visible to relevant departments (e.g., Operations Control, Crew Scheduling).<br><br>Step 5: Delete or Archive Flight Records (Flight Lifecycle Management)<br>Goal: Manage removal or archival of outdated or inactive flight schedules while ensuring data traceability.<br>Execution Method & Rules:<br>- Delete Flight:<br>+ Only allowed if the flight has no existing bookings or dependent records.<br>+ Requires confirmation prompt: “Are you sure you want to delete this flight?”<br>- Archive Flight:<br>+ Used for completed flights or old schedules.<br>+ Archived flights remain read-only and stored for reference and reporting.<br>- System Behavior:<br>+ Deleted flights removed from active view but retained in audit logs.<br>+ Archived flights accessible through the “Archived Flights” tab.<br>+ Attempting to delete a flight with active bookings → display error: “Cannot delete flight with existing reservations.”<br><br>Step 6: Synchronize and Validate Across Systems (Data Integrity & Consistency)<br>Goal: Ensure all modifications to flight information are reflected across connected systems for accuracy.<br>System Behavior & Rules:<br>- Automatic synchronization occurs between:<br>+ Booking/Ticketing System: Updates flight times, availability, and route info.<br>+ Crew Management System: Updates assigned crew schedules.<br>+ Aircraft Maintenance System: Updates aircraft utilization logs.<br>Validation Rules:<br>- Any data conflict (e.g., mismatched aircraft ID) triggers warning: “Inconsistent aircraft assignment detected.”<br>- Conflicts logged and flagged
